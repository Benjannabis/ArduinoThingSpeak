# ArduinoThingSpeak

Arduino program for Thingspeak IoT from Mathlab

## Description

This is a code that I made for Arduino. It is a program that reads info from DHT11 sensor (Temperature and Humidity), and sends it to ThingSpeak.com, where I can see a graph with all the data. All this using an ENC28J60 Ethernet module.
